# Hotel Miranda Dashboard

Hotel Miranda is the main project of the training at the OXYGEN Academy. It is the combination of the hotelÂ´s landing page [Hotel Miranda](https://simoncriado.github.io/Hotel-Miranda/) and the admin dashboard. It is still under construction and at the moment both parts of the project are not connected. I will update the README once this connection happens. Current key funcitonalities:

- Login / logout using React context and reducers.
- Dashboard with a functional calender that gives you information about the check ins and check out happening in the time frame selected.
- Dashboard with a graph that displays sales and occupancy. ATM with hard coded data. Will be dynamic in the future.
- Bookings page following the CRUD pattern. Possibility to create, read, update and delete bookings.
- Rooms page folliwing the same pattern. Adding drag and drop functionality for each room table row.
- Reviews and users pages to display data and some filter options.
- Possibility to edit the currently logged in user.

A more detailed description will follow as I develop further functionalities.

## Tech used

React, React Router, Redux, TypeScript (all TS is added on the TypeScript branch of this project), Styled Components.
I will be completing this section as the project is still under construction!
